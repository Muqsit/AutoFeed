**How to download and set up**:
- If you are looking for a .phar, you can grab one from: https://github.com/Muqsit/AutoFeed/releases. Or you can download the source, if you are that kind of a person.
- To use /af or /autofeed, you will need to give yourself the perm ```autofeed.me```. This can be done by downloading any permission-based plugin like PurePerms.
- That's it. Config isn't needed.
